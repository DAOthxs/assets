# How to Deposit Satoshi Tribute Liquidity on Dedust
In liquidity provision, two tokens are always added in equal proportions based on the current rate on DeDust.io. E.g. if you are adding 100 SATOSHI, the exchange interface will automatically determine the necessary amount of TON to add liquidity.

❗Blockchain fees are applied when you add or withdraw tokens from the liquidity pool. Therefore, it is advisable to retain a balance of at least 1,5 TON in your wallet. Still, these fees are relatively small.
## W**hat you need to add SATOSHI to the liquidity pool**
* A non-custodial wallet, where you have logged in using a 24-word secret phrase (seed phrase).
* Tokens you plan to add to the liquidity pool.
* Connect your wallet to DeDust.io.

1. Open the Pools section.
2. Search for the liquidity pair you want or pick from the list — we're using SATOSHI/TON.

❗**When you add SATOSHI and TON to the pool, they are removed from your wallet, but you would receive special LP tokens in return. These LP tokens prove that you own a part of the SATOSHI/TON pool and allow you to withdraw SATOSHI and TON later on. Make sure to keep them safe.**
